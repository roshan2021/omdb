# omdb

This project utilizes the OMDB API to search for a movie and display the search results.  A user can create a username and password to log into the app to search for movies. A user can click on a single movie to view movie details and click on a bookmark to add it to their wishlist.  

The project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Java, MySQL, JWT, and Spring Boot.
